This covers user sessions, boots, shutdowns and system time changes.
Because FreeBSD discards fields for the entries of the utx file based on type (see `man getutxent`), no direct parsing of the file using "vtypes" is done (too complicated for me to define a structure for parsing), but rather native tools are used for accessing the data.</description></item><item><title>Server.Hunt.Comparison</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/exchange/artifacts/pages/server.hunt.comparison</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app//exchange/artifacts/pages/server.hunt.comparison</guid><description>This artifact is used to compare other artifacts from two different hunts. The basic idea is that a baseline (Hunt 1) is created from selected artifacts before an attack. A second hunt (Hunt 2) can then be carried out after the attack using the same artifacts. Now, using this script, artifacts from both hunts can be compared. This allows legitimate activities to be filtered out and makes it easier to identify malicious activities in Hunt2.</description></item><item><title>Windows.Sysinternals.PSShutdown</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/exchange/artifacts/pages/windows.sysinternals.psshutdown</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app//exchange/artifacts/pages/windows.sysinternals.psshutdown</guid><description>PsShutdown is a command-line utility similar to the shutdown utility from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit, but with the ability to do much more. In addition to supporting the same options for shutting down or rebooting the local or a remote computer, PsShutdown can logoff the console user or lock the console (locking requires Windows 2000 or higher).
